\chapter{Future improvements}

\textbf{MAIN IDEA (DRAFT):\\}

In the future I want to train the network to segment the gates in the
picture instead of outputting a region proposal. I can very easily generate a
mask for the gates in the image, and use that as a ground truth.

The network would probably learn much better since it is way more correlated
than regions in the image, and then I could apply a simple geometric center
detection algorithm, as it has been seen recently in drone racing.


This would combine the power and robustness of a CNN with the simplicity and
efficiency of a rule-based algorithm.\\


Maybe I could even use deep reinforcement learning directly with a CNN input
(as done by DeepMind) to generate motion primitives at each N frames or
something. This could be integrated in a simulation environment, but only if
the gate detection is robust enough to work in simulation.\\

I could also couple a Single Shot Detector like SSDLight or something to the
CNN. Single Shot Dectectors are probably better than my own FLC.
