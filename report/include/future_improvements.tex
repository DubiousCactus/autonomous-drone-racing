\chapter{Future improvements}

\textbf{MAIN IDEA (DRAFT):}

In the future I want to train the network to segment the gates in the
picture instead of outputting a region proposal. I can very easily generate a
mask for the gates in the image, and use that as a ground truth.

The network would probably learn much better since it is way more correlated
than regions in the image, and then I could apply a simple geometric center
detection algorithm, as it has been seen recently in drone racing.


This would combine the power and robustness of a CNN with the simplicity and
efficiency of a rule-based algorithm.
