\chapter{Introduction}

Each year, the robotic community gathers at conferences such as IROS
(International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems), where they
exhibit their discoveries and achievements in the field. For the year 2019, the
Drone Racing League will be hosting a series of races which autonomous drones
will compete and attempt to outperform a professional drone pilot.\\

The company Lockheed Martin is sponsoring the event and offering a prize of 2
million USD for the winning team. Teams of university students and other drone
enthusiasts shall present innovative approaches on vision-based systems for
unmanned aerial vehicles: hence, they showcase their progress through racing.\\
