\subsection{Problem statement}

\
To properly train a convolutional neural network, it is crucial to collect a
balanced dataset representing all possible cases as to produce a robust and
stable model. This task can be tedious, especially for the case of supervised
learning where each sample must be annotated with the desired learned output.\\
