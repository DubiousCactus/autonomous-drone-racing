\section*{Abstract}

\textbf{Temporary draft}

The focus of this research is on developing a robust and generalized vision
algorithm for detecting obstacles in a hasty manner and regardless of their
shape and color, such that the racing gates can be specified prior to the
training of the algorithm, and thus tailored to the challenge itself. The end
goal is to greatly facilitate the learning of the vision-based detection model,
by automating the tedious and long process of collecting and annotating a large
dataset required to train the object detection algorithm using Deep Learning.

Indeed, this task is often the most time-consuming part of training
convolutional neural networks, mostly because each image must be annotated to
be used in supervised learning. By removing this weight off researchers'
shoulders, much more time is left to focus and experiment on the
\emph{planning} and \emph{acting} problems of the robotic paradigm

In this work, the efficiency and robustness of tailored dataset generation for
Deep Learning-based computer vision algorithms, for the specific case of
autonomous drone racing, is analysed and discussed.  A simple approach to
solving the \emph{planning} challenge is also undertaken, which supports the
praises of the proposed solution.
