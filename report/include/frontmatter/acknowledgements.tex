\section*{Acknowledgements}

I am thankful to my supervisor Erdal Kayacan, without whom I would not have had
this amazing opportunity to work on such a fascinating topic at the Control and
Automation Laboratory. I also thank Andriy Sarabakha, for his valuable advices
and guidance throughout this project. Both see me grateful for their expertise
in this innovating research area, and their advanced knowledge could only
encourage me to pursue a career in the research sector.

Furthermore, I would like to express my best regards to Aarhus University,
where I had a wonderful time and a circle of acquaintances that sparked my
interest in learning and developing my curiosity.

Finally, I must thank my dear friend Hannes Bartle for the continuous support
and friendship during those two years of hard labor, and for dreaming with me
about revolutionizing the world.
