\section{The chosen approach}


The solution will be implemented iteratively, by gradually increasing the
complexity of the vision algorithms, such that progress can be made even if the
end goal is too difficult to achieve.\\

The project should attempt to fulfill the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Recognize gates in the input image}
	\item{Detect and localize the closest gate's center}
	\item{Evaluate the closest gate's orientation and distance}
	\item{Plan a trajectory for the drone to fly across the gate center}
	\item{Refine the trajectory in real time, for an optimal flight time}
	\item{Make the drone follow that trajectory while adjusting in real time}
\end{itemize}
~\\
However, the following functionalities are out of the scope and will be
discarded:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Detect any other obstacles in the input image}
	\item{Avoid obstacles that are on the drone's trajectory}
	\item{Map and localize the detected gates in world frame}
	\item{Plan a trajectory of a sequence of gates}
	\item{Apply online learning for adaptive racing}
\end{itemize}
